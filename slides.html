# Deletable & Defensive Code


---

# Agenda

1. What and why?
2. Story
3. Code Examples!

---

## What is Deletable Code?

code that can be (re)moved or replaced without major overhaul

---

## Why is this good?
* deletable == testable
* safeguard against over-engineering
* business needs change (frequently)

???
deletable code is pretty self-contained, so chances
are good it can be tested easily

armor-plated "permanent fixes" are probably bad and costly

real benefit of this comes from organizing and writing code in this mindset

---

## What are some qualities of deletable code?
 * code that is modular
 * minimal API surface
 * information hiding!

???
Information hiding is idea of keeping internal parts of a module private
only exposing to other programs just what is needed
